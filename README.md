# E05-Input

This is an exercise from class MSCH-G220 Game Technology that serves as our "intro to GODOT's user input" basically. 

Note: this is the most basic frameworks of a game, in which case it currently only tracks the movement of the mouse, and allows the player to move the spaceship using the WASD keys.

Enjoy giving the spaceship zoomies based on your inputs!
